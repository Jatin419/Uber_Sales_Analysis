🚖 Uber Trip Data Analysis using Python

📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-world Uber trip data to uncover insights such as ride patterns, peak hours, and popular pickup/drop-off locations. Using powerful Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify demand trends that can enhance Uber’s service planning and operational strategies.

🧩 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🔍 Key Steps

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values and inconsistent data types.

Removed duplicates and formatted datetime features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed trip distribution by time, date, and location.

Identified peak demand hours and busiest days.

Explored popular pickup & drop-off locations.

Data Visualization:

Created insightful charts showing trends in ride volume.

Visualized correlations and geospatial trip distributions.

📈 Insights

Peak hours were typically during morning and evening commutes.

Weekdays saw higher trip frequencies compared to weekends.

Certain city zones showed consistent high demand, suggesting optimization opportunities for driver allocation.

🧠 Outcome

Delivered clear and actionable insights that could help optimize fleet management and improve user experience for Uber.
